Assignment:
For this assignment, you will create a simple JavaScript application that will utilize callback functions.

To complete this homework, complete the following:

Create a folder called homework-two.
You can either create an html/javascript file pair or write the javascript directly in the html file. 
Your html portion of this homework will include the following:
Largest heading with text: Callback Functions
Second largest heading with the current date.
Second largest heading with your name.
1st paragraph will include the two numbers. (read below)
2nd paragraph will include the total value. (read below)
3rd paragraph will include the average. (read below)
Using your knowledge of targeting elements WITHOUT using IDs, add the information above to your HTML WITHOUT using IDs.
You will create a higher order function that will take in two numeric parameters and a callback function.
The higher order function will find the arithmetic values of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of the two numbers. 
You will use these values in your callback function and go through the values to find the average of all the values. 
Use the data from your functions to display the information listed above. 
Upload your project to the web 4 server.
Create a readme.md file. (This will be the file where you add your web4 link).
Add the web 4 link to the readme.md file. 
Commit and push your homework-two folder to github.
Submit your github for the assignment submission.
